## Dev Tools (Inspector)

The **Developer Tools**, commonly referred to as **DevTools**, are built-in browser tools that help developers debug and optimize their web pages. They are essential for web development and offer functionalities such as inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, debugging, and performance monitoring. This document focuses on the **Inspector** tool.

### Key Features of the Inspector

- Navigate through the DOM tree to locate and modify elements.
- Add, edit, or remove attributes and tags directly.

#### CSS Inspection
- View and edit the applied styles for any selected element.
- Check for inherited styles and cascading rules.
- Toggle CSS properties on/off to test changes.

#### Box Model Visualization
- Inspect the box model of any element, including margin, border, padding, and content.

### How to Use the Inspector
